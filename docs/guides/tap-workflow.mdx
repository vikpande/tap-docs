# TAP Workflow

The Trust Assurance Protocol (TAP) workflow encompasses the complete journey from agent development to marketplace deployment. Here's how it works:

## Workflow Overview:

1. **Agent Development & Registration**
   - Developers build AI agents using supported frameworks (LangChain, Kite SDK, etc.)
   - Register the agent with TAP by providing metadata and ownership proof
   - Receive a unique agent identifier for tracking

2. **Identity & Credential Issuance**
   - TAP coordinates with Cheqd to issue Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)
   - Agent receives initial verifiable credentials establishing its identity
   - Credentials are cryptographically signed and stored on-chain

3. **Multi-Layer Verification**
   - **Compute Verification**: EigenCloud validates the execution environment using TEE attestation
   - **Data Quality**: TheHive.ai reviews training data for bias, completeness, and compliance
   - **Policy Compliance**: TAP Policy Engine checks against regulatory requirements (EU AI Act, GDPR, etc.)

4. **TrustScore Calculation**
   - TAP aggregates all verification results from partners
   - Computes a composite TrustScore based on weighted criteria
   - Issues the AI Agent Passport containing all verified credentials

5. **Marketplace Publication**
   - Verified agents are published to OneStopAgents marketplace
   - Users can view TrustScore, credentials, and verification details
   - Agents become available for task execution

6. **Runtime Monitoring & Compliance**
   - Continuous logging of agent activities and task executions
   - Manual auditors review compliance logs and investigate anomalies
   - Periodic re-verification ensures ongoing trust integrity
