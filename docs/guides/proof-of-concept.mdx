# Proof of Concept

We are building a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how multiple trust components can work together to verify the actions of an AI agent from start to finish.

**Goal:** The goal is to create a closed trust loop where every step, from identity to execution, can be verified, audited, and trusted.

## Connected Systems

| Component | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| **OneStopAgents** | The interface where AI agents are deployed and run tasks. |
| **Agent Passport** | A digital credential that proves the agent's identity and permissions. |
| **Cheqd** | Issues and verifies decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and credentials. |
| **EigenCloud** | Confirms that each AI task was executed securely in a verified environment. |
| **TAP (Trust Assurance Protocol)** | Applies trust rules, validates credentials, and records compliance results. |
| **Manual Auditor** | Reviews trust logs, investigates exceptions, and ensures end-to-end integrity. |

## What the PoC Shows

The PoC shows that an AI agent can:

- **Prove its identity** using a verified Agent Passport
- **Execute a verified task** within a trusted environment
- **Be evaluated for compliance** through TAP
- **Produce results** that are verifiable and auditable

## The Trust Loop

**Identity → Task → Proof → Trust Decision**

### Identity
Cheqd issues a decentralized ID; the Agent Passport stores verified credentials.

### Task
The agent executes a job on OneStopAgents.

### Proof
EigenCloud provides an attestation confirming secure execution.

### Trust Decision
TAP checks all credentials and logs the outcome for auditors.

Together, these components form a **transparent and verifiable cycle of trust**—a foundation for reliable AI operations. This flow ensures every output is tied back to a trusted source and verified process.
