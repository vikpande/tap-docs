## A. Sequential Workflow Diagram

![Sequential Diagram Workflow](/img/seq_diagram_workflow.jpeg)

### Workflow steps:

1. **Developer registers the agent with TAP.**

2. **TAP calls Cheqd** for identity issuance and VC validation.

3. **EigenCloud provides infrastructure attestation** → credential stored in Cheqd.

4. **Data verifier (TheHive.ai) provides dataset quality credential** → stored in Cheqd.

5. **TAP aggregates all proofs**, computes the TrustScore, and issues the AI Agent Passport.

6. **Verified agents appear on OneStopAgents**, with runtime execution continuing to produce logs.

7. **Manual Auditors** oversee compliance, investigate anomalies, and maintain network integrity.

## B. Trust Assurance Protocol — Partner-Based Flow

![Sequential Diagram Events](/img/seq_diagram_events.jpeg)

### 1. Developer / Project Owner

**Objective:** Initiate trust registration for their AI agent.

**Steps:**

1. Build the AI agent (e.g., "PortfolioMax AI") using frameworks like LangChain or Kite SDK.

2. Submit agent registration to TAP.

3. Provide metadata and proof of ownership to TAP for initial identity verification.

4. Optionally upload model metadata, training dataset links, and compliance references (SEC, GDPR, etc.).

### 2. TAP (Trust Assurance Protocol)

**Objective:** Orchestrate trust verification and enforce policy compliance.

**Core Responsibilities:**

- **Identity Orchestration:** Requests DIDs and credentials from Cheqd.

- **Verification Logic:** Enforces rules via the Policy Engine:
  - **TAP-001:** Agent must hold valid DID/VC.
  - **TAP-002:** Only approved tasks allowed in this phase (e.g., public_data).
  - **TAP-003:** All executions must carry an EigenCloud attestation hash.

- **Attestation & Compliance:**
  - Validates infra proof from EigenCloud.
  - Validates data proof from TheHive.ai.
  - Logs all results via Compliance Logger.

- **TrustScore Generation:**
  
  Aggregates verified results to create a composite trust profile.

- **Publication:** Pushes verified agents and scores to OneStopAgents marketplace.

### 3. Cheqd (Identity & Credential Layer)

**Objective:** Manage decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs).

**Responsibilities:**

1. Issue DIDs for the developer and their AI agent.

2. Store and sign credentials related to:
   - Agent identity (ownership, organization)
   - Compute verification (from EigenCloud)
   - Data quality credentials (from TheHive.ai)

3. Provide APIs for TAP to check revocation status, validity, and expiry of all VCs.

4. Act as the source of truth for identity and credential integrity.

---

### 4. EigenCloud (Trusted Compute Layer)

**Objective:** Verify that the AI agent's runtime environment is secure.

**Responsibilities:**

1. Provide TEE-based secure execution environment for deployed agents.

2. Generate cryptographic attestation proofs that confirm:
   - Model execution occurred within a verified enclave.
   - No tampering or data leakage occurred.

3. Issue a compute verification credential to Cheqd.

4. Respond to TAP's verification queries with attestation hash confirmations.

---

### 5. Data Verifier (e.g., TheHive.ai)

**Objective:** Validate training or operational datasets for quality and compliance.

**Responsibilities:**

1. Review submitted datasets for bias, quality, and completeness.

2. Issue a data verification credential (VC) to Cheqd, confirming data quality score.

3. Optionally include metadata such as source integrity, dataset size, and domain applicability.

---

### 6. OneStopAgents Marketplace

**Objective:** Publicly list TAP-verified agents for end users and enterprises.

**Responsibilities:**

1. Display verified agent metadata, TrustScore, and verification details.

2. Serve as the execution interface for task requests and results.

3. Log runtime task calls back to TAP for compliance and re-verification.

---

### 7. Manual Auditor

**Objective:** Provide human oversight, integrity assurance, and exception handling.

**Responsibilities:**

1. Periodically review compliance logs, audit trails, and anomalies from TAP.

2. Verify evidence hashes (attestations, timestamps, VCs).

3. Flag inconsistencies or revoke credentials if trust violations occur.

4. Sign off on periodic trust integrity reports.
