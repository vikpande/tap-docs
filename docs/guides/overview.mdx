# Overview

Welcome to the Trust Assurance Protocol (TAP) documentation.

## What is TAP?

TAP is a simple but powerful idea. It defines how AI credentials should be created, verified, revoked, and enforced. Each AI agent carries a verifiable credential—a kind of digital passport—that can be checked instantly by anyone using cryptographic proofs.

**TAP replaces static, centralized checks with programmable trust.**

## What TAP Verifies

It verifies that:

- The agent's identity is real and issued by an approved source
- The credentials haven't expired or been revoked
- The agent's actions follow agreed-upon rules

Behind the scenes, TAP uses signatures, proofs, and attestations to confirm every step.

**This turns trust from something you assume into something you can verify.**

## The Full Trust Cycle

By connecting verifiable credentials, attested compute, and transparent rules, TAP creates a full trust cycle: agents prove who they are, complete a verified task, and record their results for audit or compliance.
